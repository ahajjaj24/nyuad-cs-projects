# Beam Deflection Calculator

This project was completed for **Computer Programming for Engineers (Spring 2025)** at NYU Abu Dhabi.  

It calculates the **vertical deflection of a simply supported beam** under a point load using C++.  

## Features
- Menu-driven system for easy navigation
- Input validation (no negative or unrealistic values allowed)
- Supports updating parameters (beam length, load, Young’s modulus, etc.)
- Outputs deflection at a specific point along the beam

## Files
- `main.cpp` → C++ source code
- `report.pdf` → Full project report with problem statement, algorithm, and test cases

## How to Compile and Run
```bash
g++ main.cpp -o beam
./beam
