# Transient Conduction Case Study

This project was completed for **Computer Programming for Engineers (Spring 2025)** at NYU Abu Dhabi.  
It calculates the **transient temperature distribution** in a semi-infinite solid subjected to a constant surface heat flux.

## Features
- Validates user inputs
- Computes thermal diffusivity
- Implements analytical solution with exponential & error function terms
- Displays results and plots **T vs x** for times 200, 400, 600, 800 seconds
- Handles invalid inputs with error messages

## Files
- `report.pdf` → Assignment report with algorithm, pseudocode, and analysis
- `main.m` (if included) → MATLAB/Octave implementation

## Run (MATLAB/Octave)
```matlab
run('main.m')
